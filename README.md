real_gas_sim.py allows you to conduct a 2d simulation of a gas in which molecules interact absolutely elastically. the control is performed using the keys:
# esc to end
# "c" (English) to start reducing the volume of the gas area (addiabatic compression)
# "e" (English) to start increasing the volume of the gas area (addiabatic expansion)
# "shift" to start Increasing the total kinetic energy of the particles (heating)
# "alt" to start reducing the total kinetic energy of the particles (cooling)
# "ctrl" to complete compression/expansion
During operation, the movement of the particles in the provided volume and the histogram of their velocity distribution are displayed.
Using the keys described above, it is possible to change the thermodynamic parameters of the system. Changing the internal energy of the system is possible only by running the appropriate functions. No heat loss is provided. The terminal displays the values of the volume, energy of the system, the average speed and the operating mode of the program.

WARNING: The control is performed using the keyboard switched to the English layout and with the Caps turned off.
